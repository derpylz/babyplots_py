Description: # babyplots - Easy, fast, interactive 3D visualizations
        
        Babyplots is an easy to use library for creating interactive 3d graphs for exploring and presenting data.
        
        **Find the full documentation [here](https://bp.bleb.li/documentation/js).**
        
        ## Usage
        
        You can download the minified babyplots library [here](dist/babyplots.js) and include it in your header.
        
        To display a babyplots visualization, you need a canvas element with an id somewhere in the body of your html file.
        
        ```html
        <canvas id="babyplot"></canvas>
        ```
        
        Then you can initialize the Plots object, which stores the settings and data of the visualization:
        
        ```javascript
        var vis = new Baby.Plots("babyplot", {backgroundColor: "#ffffffff"});
        ```
        
        The first argument of the constructor is the id of the canvas, the second is an object containing options to customize the appearance of the whole visualization. You can find about the possible options [here](https://bp.bleb.li/documentation/js#plotsObject).
        
        Once you have a Plots object, you can add plots to it. Either manually, from data, or from a JSON object, exported from one of the babyplots implementations (e.g. the [R package](https://bp.bleb.li/documentation/r), or the [Interactive Node Creator](https://bp.bleb.li/documentation/creator)).
        
        ```javascript
        vis.fromJSON(myPlotData);
        ```
        
        Lastly, to show the visualization, call the `doRender()` method:
        
        ```javascript
        vis.doRender();
        ```
        
        In conclusion, here is a minimal example of how to create a babyplots visualization:
        
        ```html
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <head>
          <script src="babyplots.js"></script>
        </head>
        <body>
          <canvas id="babyplot"></canvas>
          <script>
            var vis = Baby.Plots("babyplot", {backgroundColor:"#ffffffff"});
            vis.fromJSON(myPlotData);
            vis.doRender();
          </script>
        </body>
        </html>
        ```
